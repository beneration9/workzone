# Work Zone
## About
Work Zone is a Petscop fangame/parody engine, written in Godot. It is designed to have everything you need to make something out of the box, similiar to *Pokemon Essentials*, and in-game editors like Friday Night Funkin's [Codename Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine), including but not limited to a 3D map editor.

It uses [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), and this [retro shaders pack](https://github.com/Zorochase/ultimate-retro-shader-collection).
